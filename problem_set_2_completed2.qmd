## Question 1

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` data, produce a scatterplot of the variables `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (with `womleg_2015` as the dependent variable on the y-axis). Describe the scatterplot and include a copy of it. Note any suspected outliers, if any (a visual inspection will suffice for this question). Lastly, give the general equation for the correlation between `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (include as much information as possible), but do not solve it.

::: callout-note
The `states` data set can be found in `poliscidata::states`. Take a look at `?states` to see what these variables measure.
:::

```{r}
# Scatterplot 
ggplot(data = states, aes(x = libpct_m, y = womleg_2015)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot",
    x = " Frequency Mass Public Liberal",
    y = "Women Legislator in 2015"
  )
 cor(states$womleg_2015, states$libpct_m)
```

ANSWER: Correlation equation:

$$Y= \beta_0+\beta_1(x)$$

Y = womleg_2015 + 0.6088(libpct_m)

Scatter plot description: There are some outliers that we cannot explain on the scatter plot

## Question 2

*Points: 5*

Regress `womleg_2015` (as the dependent variable) on `libpct_m` and report the results in a professionally formatted table. Write the model equation with the estimated coefficients and interpret them. What does the value of $R^2$ tell us about this model?

Model equation: Y = womleg_2015 + (libpct_m)(x)

$$Y = 1.53 + 1.15(libpct_m)$$

```{r}
regress_m_1 <- lm(womleg_2015 ~ libpct_m, states)
regress_m_1

modelsummary(
  regress_m_1, 
  statistic = NULL,
  coef_rename = c("libpct_m" = "Public_liberal"),
  gof_map = "nobs"
)

summary(regress_m_1)

glance(regress_m_1)
```

ANSWER: R squared is around .3707, which shows us a relatively weak relationship with the regression model and won't be able describe our dependent variable with confidence.

## Question 3

*Points: 5*

Based on this regression, find the predicted value, the observed value, and compute the residual for the state of Colorado and then the state of Georgia. Lastly, compute the total aggregate error from those two select observations combined (i.e., Colorado and Georgia).

#predicted value GA

beta_0 + beta_1 * 17.61538

#observed 

#GA=17.61538 CO=21.67878

#residual 4.0634

 21.67878-17.61538
```

ANSWER:

Predicted values

GA: 21.71096

CO: 26.36756

Residual: 4.0634

## Question 4

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` dataset, assess the relationship between the following two variables: `obama_win12` and `gun_rank3`. Construct a cross-tab and describe the nature of the relationship (if any) in detail.

::: callout-note
The variable `Obama_win12` is a dichotomous indicator of whether Obama won the state in 2012 (Obama won; Obama lost). The variable `gun_rank3` represents the general (ordinal) extent of gun restrictions in each state (more restrictions; middle restrictions; less restrictions).
:::

::: callout-caution
Please note that you would customarily want a greater number of observations within each cell before conducting such an analysis.
:::

```{r}
library(poliscidata)
library(modelsummary)

datasummary_crosstab(obama_win12 ~ gun_rank3, data = states)
```

ANSWER: The relationship between gun restriction and Obama winning states in 2012, when there were more restrictions on guns, Obama won(restriction 14). When Obama had less restriction (1) on guns, he lost the state.

## Question 5

*Points: 5*

I hypothesize that religious identifiers in the mass public are less likely to support federal government support of scientific research. I use data from the General Social Survey to evaluate this hypothesis. In particular, I use a three-category indicator of religious attendance to measure religious identification (low attendance; moderate attendance; high attendance) and a three-category indicator of perceptions toward the federal government's support for scientific research (federal government provides "too little" support; "about right"; federal government provides "too much" support). Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis.

::: callout-note
Table entries are raw counts of observations within each cell.
:::

![](img/ps2_cross_tab.png)

ANSWER: The column totals

Too little Column: 714, 39.2739%

About right: 856, 47.0847%

Too much: 248, 13.6414%

The row totals:

Low: 804, 44.2244%

Moderate: 454, 24.9725%

High: 560, 30.8030

total row/column: 1,818

Evaluate: The hypothesis is moderately weak. When there is high religious attendance, we should see a high number in perception that the government provides "too much" government support for scientific research; but we don't, its 5.0055% compared to 10.0110% (too little) and 15.7866% (about right).

But if we go the other way, if they have low religious attendance, based on the hypothesis we should expect that their perception is either "too little" or "about right". This is what we see in the cross tab (low 18.8119%, about right 19.5819% and too much 5.8310%)

## Question 6

*Points: 5*

Say I wish to explore the relationship between the relative advantage of Democrats (`dem_advantage`) in a state and abortion policy (`abort_rank3`). The `dem_advantage` variable is a continuous indicator where higher values represent a greater Democratic advantage among the mass public; `abort_rank3` is an ordinal indicator for the extent of abortion restrictions in each state (fewer restrictions; middle restrictions; more restrictions). To explore this relationship, complete the following:

### Part A

Create a new variable (i.e., `dem_adv`) based on the `dem_advantage` variable. Calculate the summary statistics of `dem_advantage` and assign the following values to our new variable: if `dem_advantage` is less than the first quartile, set `dem_adv` to `Low`; if the value for `dem_advantage` is greater than the first quartile and less than the third quartile, set the value to `Mid`; and if the value of `dem_advantage` is greater than the third quartile, set the value to `High`.

```{r}

quartiles <- quantile(states$dem_advantage, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
quartiles

states <- states <- states %>%
  mutate(dem_adv = case_when(
    dem_advantage < quartiles[1] ~ "Low",
    dem_advantage >= quartiles[1] & dem_advantage < quartiles[2] ~ "Mid",
    dem_advantage > quartiles[2] ~ "High"
  ))

summary(states$dem_advantage)

```

ANSWER: High: 13 Mid: 24 Low: 13

### Part B

Create a crosstab using R; include your results in a professionally formatted table.

```{r}
datasummary_crosstab(abort_rank3 ~ dem_adv, data = states)

```

### Part C

What relationship (if any) is there between the relative advantage of Democrats is a given state and the restrictiveness of Abortion policy?

We see a relationship between the relative advantage of Democrats and restrictiveness of abortion policy;

-   When a state has lower abortion restrictions, the Democrat advantage in the state is high 56.2%,

-   When the state as more restrictive abortion policy, we see the democrat advantage is not high (0.00% ) at all, it is low (35.3%) to mid (64.7%)
