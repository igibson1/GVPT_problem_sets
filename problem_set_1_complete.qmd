## Question 1

*Points: 5*

Using the `gss` dataset (which has survey data with the individual respondent as the unit of analysis), create a frequency distribution and bar chart for each of the following variables: `degree` and `partyid_3`. Describe the distribution of each variable in detail.

::: callout-note
The `gss` dataset can be found in `poliscidata::gss`. Take a look at `?gss` to see what these variables measure.
:::

```{r}
degree_data <- select(poliscidata::gss, degree)

degree <- table(degree_data)

barplot(degree, main = "Frequency of Degree", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Frequency")

summary(degree)
```

```{r}
partyid_data <- select(poliscidata::gss, partyid_3)

partyid <- table(partyid_data)

barplot(partyid, main = "Frequency of partyid", xlab = "partyid", ylab = "Frequency")

summary(partyid)
```

## Question 2

Examine the following vector of (fake) student IQ test scores:

```{r}
iq <- c(
  145, 139, 126, 122, 125, 130, 96, 110, 118, 118, 101, 142, 134, 124, 112, 109, 
  134, 113, 81, 113, 123, 94, 100, 136, 109, 131, 117, 110, 127, 124, 106, 124, 
  115, 133, 116, 102, 127, 117, 109, 137, 117, 90, 103, 114, 139, 101, 122, 105, 
  97, 89, 102, 108, 110, 128, 114, 112, 114, 102, 82, 101
)
```

### Part A

*Points: 5*

Find the five-number summary, mean, and standard deviation for these data. Also, are there any suspected outliers in the distribution? If so, what are they and how do you know?

```{r}
summary(iq)
iq_sd <- sd(iq)
iq_sd
```

ANSWER:

### Part B

*Points: 5*

In large populations, IQ scores are standardized to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In what way does the distribution among these students differ from the overall population?

```{r}
mean <- mean(iq)

sd <- sd(iq)

standard <- (iq - mean)/sd * 15 + 100 

barplot(iq, main = "IQ scores", xlab = "student scores", ylab = "mean") 

```

## Question 3

*Points: 5*

A polling firm is interested in determining how different characteristics of an individual affect vote choice. They record the following characteristics for each survey respondent - race, age, household income, and party affiliation. What "type" of variable does each characteristic most likely represent?

Race is the categorical variable

Age is the continuous variable

Household income is the continuous

Party affiliation is the Categorical

## Question 4

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` dataset (the unit of analysis is each U.S. state), generate a box plot and density curve for each of the `vep12_turnout` and `cig_tax12` variables. Describe the distribution of each variable in detail.

::: callout-note
The `states` data set can be found in `poliscidata::states`. Take a look at `?states` to see what these variables measure.
:::

```{r}
poliscidata::states
boxplot(states$vep12_turnout)
boxplot(states$cig_tax12)
plot(density(states$cig_tax12))
plot(density(states$vep12_turnout))

?states
```

Percent turnout of voting eligible population (2012)

-   The density curve shows a normal distribution

Cigarette tax per pack (2012)

-   The density curve shows a skewed right distribution
